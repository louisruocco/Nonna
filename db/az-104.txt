Azure Import/Export | Export Jobs only allow data to be exported from Blob Storage
Only zone redundant replication (ZRS) supports StorageV2, FileStorage, and BlockBlobStorage accounts and only standard storage accounts can be used
File shares can be configured to use Azure AD Kerberos
Before configuring object replication, you must enable blob versioning for both storage accounts, and you must enable the change feed for the source account.
Live migration is only supported by accounts that have LRS or GRS replication
Only General purpose v2 accounts support converting to ZRS
Azure file sync can replicate files to different shares
A sync group cannot have more than one cloud endpoint attached to it
Immutability cannot be disabled after it has been enabled on the storage account
Maximum number of fault domains = 3
Maximum number of update domains = 20
App Service Plans are created as per the Operating System type
You can detach a disk from a running virtual machine
Azure DNS provides automatic registration of VMs from a single virtual network that's linked to a private zone as a registration virtual network.

Azure resources connected to a VNet have outbound connectivity to the internet by default
By default, all VMs in a Vnet can communicate with each other, regardless of what subnet they are in
Azure Disk encryption (ADE) has 4 characteristics | DM-Crypt for Linux, backed up to a Recovery Services Vault, Integrated with Azure Key Vault, Uses Bitlocker for Windows VM disks
